# Simple Article Listing 📰

This project is a solution to the **Simple Article Listing** challenge from [DevChallenges.io](https://www.devchallenges.io/).

The goal of this challenge was to build a clean, responsive article listing layout using semantic HTML and a mobile-first CSS approach.

## 📸 Overview

The page displays a collection of technology-related articles. Each article includes:

* A featured image
* A title
* A publication date

The layout adapts responsively across different screen sizes.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a responsive article listing layout
* Practice semantic HTML structure
* Apply mobile-first CSS principles
* Improve layout alignment using Flexbox
* Maintain clean and scalable CSS organization

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – For semantic structure and content organization

## 📱 Responsive Design Approach

This project follows a **mobile-first methodology**:

* On **mobile**, articles are stacked vertically.
* On **tablet (768px and above)**:

  * Article cards switch to a horizontal layout.
  * Images increase in size.
  * Spacing between elements is refined for better readability.

This ensures a smooth visual transition between screen sizes.
