# DevChallenges 🚀

This repository documents my learning journey through practical web development challenges provided by [DevChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/).

The purpose of this project is to strengthen my skills by building real, hands-on solutions — starting from the basics of web development and gradually progressing toward more advanced frontend and full-stack concepts.

Each challenge completed in this repository is treated as an independent learning milestone and is accompanied by its own README file explaining the challenge, lessons learned, and difficulties faced.

## 📈 Learning Approach

For each challenge, I follow a structured approach:

1. Understand the problem and requirements
2. Break the solution into manageable components
3. Implement the solution using appropriate technologies
4. Refactor and improve code clarity where necessary
5. Apply responsive design principles
6. Document lessons learned and challenges encountered

---

## 🧪 Progress & Growth

This repository reflects continuous improvement. Earlier challenges may be revisited and refactored as my skills evolve, and new challenges will progressively introduce more complexity and depth.

Each project builds upon the previous one — reinforcing fundamentals while introducing better structure, cleaner styling, and more professional workflows.

---

## 📝 Documentation Philosophy

Documentation is an integral part of the learning process, not an afterthought.

Each README clearly explains:

* What the challenge was about
* How the solution was approached
* What was learned during implementation
* What challenges were encountered and how they were addressed
