# DevChallenges 🚀

This repository documents my learning journey through practical web development challenges provided by [DevChallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io/).

The purpose of this project is to strengthen my skills by building real, hands-on solutions — starting from the basics of web development and gradually progressing toward more advanced frontend and full-stack concepts.

Each challenge completed in this repository is treated as an independent learning milestone and is accompanied by its own README file explaining the challenge, lessons learned, and difficulties faced.


## 📂 Completed Challenges (So Far)

### 1️⃣ FAQs Page
A responsive Frequently Asked Questions page built using semantic HTML and a mobile-first CSS approach.

**Focus Areas:**
- Semantic structure
- Mobile-first styling
- Responsive design using media queries
- Clean CSS organization
- Custom UI details (divider styling, spacing refinement)
- Git branching and conventional commits

📁 Folder: `/faqs`


### 2️⃣ Card Component
A responsive card layout challenge focused on UI structure, alignment, and visual polish.

**Focus Areas:**
- Component-based layout thinking
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Clean and maintainable CSS structure
- Layout balance and visual hierarchy

📁 Folder: `/card`


## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop strong fundamentals in web development
- Practice solving real-world UI and interaction problems
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Improve debugging and problem-solving skills
- Build consistency through continuous practice
- Develop the habit of documenting technical work


## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- Semantic HTML and proper content structure
- Modern CSS for layout, styling, and responsive design
- Mobile-first development methodology
- Responsive design patterns
- Component-based architecture
- JavaScript fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Frontend development with **React**
- Server-side rendering and routing with **Next.js**
- Backend fundamentals (APIs, databases, authentication)
- Full-stack workflows and application architecture
- Accessibility best practices
- Code organization and scalability
- Technical documentation using Markdown
- Professional Git workflow (branching, merging, conventional commits)


## 📈 Learning Approach

For each challenge, I follow a structured approach:

1. Understand the problem and requirements  
2. Break the solution into manageable components  
3. Implement the solution using appropriate technologies  
4. Refactor and improve code clarity where necessary  
5. Apply responsive design principles  
6. Document lessons learned and challenges encountered  


## 🧪 Progress & Growth

This repository reflects continuous improvement. Earlier challenges may be revisited and refactored as my skills evolve, and new challenges will progressively introduce more complexity and depth.

Each project builds upon the previous one — reinforcing fundamentals while introducing better structure, cleaner styling, and more professional workflows.


## 📝 Documentation Philosophy

Documentation is an integral part of the learning process, not an afterthought.

Each README clearly explains:
- What the challenge was about  
- How the solution was approached  
- What was learned during implementation  
- What challenges were encountered and how they were addressed  


## 📌 Notes

This repository serves both as a personal learning archive and a growing portfolio of practical web development work.

Feedback, suggestions, and constructive critique are always welcome.
