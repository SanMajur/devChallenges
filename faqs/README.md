## FAQs Challenge

The FAQ page was implemented using semantic HTML to ensure a clear, accessible, and well-structured layout.

Key semantic elements used include:
- `<main>` to define the primary content of the page
- `<header>` to introduce the page title and description
- `<section>` and `<article>` to logically group FAQ items
- `<footer>` for page-specific supporting information

This approach improves accessibility, enhances document structure, and follows modern HTML best practices.

### What I Learned

- How to structure a web page using semantic HTML elements
- The importance of using `<main>` for primary content
- When to use page-level headers and footers versus global ones
- How semantic elements improve accessibility and readability
- Better organization of content using sections and articles

### Challenges Faced

- Deciding which elements belong inside `<main>` versus outside
- Choosing the correct semantic tags for FAQ content
- Maintaining a clean document outline with proper heading hierarchy
- Avoiding overuse of non-semantic `<div>` elements
